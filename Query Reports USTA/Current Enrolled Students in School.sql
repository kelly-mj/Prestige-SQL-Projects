-- 1. Current Enrolled Students in School
-- Author: Kelly MJ    |    Creation date: 7/20/18
-- Allows user to select date range, then displays students who were enrolled during that date range.
-- Kelly MJ 3/18/19 : Major changes to widget
   -- "Enrolled Students" are any students with an active registration which was active during any part of the selected date range
   -- "Active Students" are any enrolled students who were not graduated or who reached the end of the selected period with an LOA status (ie. had no graduation date by the end date and were not on LOA during the end date)
   -- "LOA Students" are any enrolled students who reached the end of the selected period with an LOA status (ie. are not graduated or have not finished their LOA by the selected end date)
   -- "Graduated Students" are any enrolled students who graduated during the selected date range
